The NEURON code contains the morphologies and biophysics (axial resistance, capacitance, and membrane leak channels) of 6 prototypical vertical system cells from the paper (Dan et al 2018).  This code was contributed by Ohad Dan. <p/>
To examine the morphologies start the simulation (no mod file compiling required) with a command like (if you need more help for your platform please consult: <a href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide">https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide</a>)<p/>

and select a (prototypical, see paper for details) VS cell, for example VS1.
An image of the cell is displayed:

We mainly utilized the trees toolbox and additional graphic edits to generate the figures in the paper.
